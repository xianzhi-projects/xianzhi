 * Security Configuration Properties
 * This class defines configuration properties for security-related settings in the application,

 * or application.yml). It includes settings for token expiration times and a whitelist of
 * permitted resources that do not require authentication. The class implements InitializingBean
 * to perform validation and initialization after properties are set, and uses Lombokâ€™s @Data to
 * generate getters, setters, and other utility methods.
