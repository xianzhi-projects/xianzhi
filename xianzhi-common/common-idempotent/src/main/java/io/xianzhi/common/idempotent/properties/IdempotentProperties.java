 * Idempotent Configuration Properties
 * This class defines configuration properties for idempotency enforcement in the system. It is
 * annotated with @ConfigurationProperties to bind properties from a configuration source (e.g.,
 * application.properties or application.yml) with the prefix "xianzhi.idempotent". The properties
 * control whether idempotency is enabled, the HTTP request header for idempotency keys, the Redis
 * storage prefix, and the expiration time for stored idempotency markers. Lombokâ€™s @Data annotation
 * generates getters, setters, and other utility methods.
