/**
 * Response Utility Class
 * This class provides static utility methods for handling HTTP responses, particularly for sending
 * JSON data to the client and retrieving the current HttpServletResponse object in a web context.
 * It is designed to simplify response handling in a servlet-based application, ensuring consistent
 * content type settings and error management. The class uses SLF4J logging for error tracking and
 * is implemented as a utility with a private constructor to prevent instantiation.
